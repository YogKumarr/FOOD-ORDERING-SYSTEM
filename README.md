To run the PHP program, you will need Apache or MYSQL databases, both supported by XAMPP

Go to “C:\xampp\htdocs” and inside it, create a folder and place the files inside

Now, to see the script output, open the XAMPP control panel and start Apache to host the local webserver, where our script will be running.

Now navigate to your browser and type in “localhost/foodweb” in the address bar to view the output.
